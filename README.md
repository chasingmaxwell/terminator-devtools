# terminator-devtools

This is a very simple URL handler plugin for Terminator which allows you to open chrome-devtools:// URLs from the terminal.

## @TODO

- Currently only copying URLs works reliably.

## Installation

1. Copy chrome_devtools_url.py to ~/.config/terminator/plugins. You may need to create the directory.
2. Open Terminator preferences and enable the ChromeDevToolsURLHandler plugin.
3. Restart Terminator.
